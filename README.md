# Day2Night-with-Pix2Pix
![](https://github.com/wz-ml/Day2Night-with-Pix2Pix/blob/master/visualization.png?raw=true)
A day-to-night image translation implementation using Pix2Pix. The model was trained on the University of Maryland's DNIM dataset for 100 epochs, and actually achieved a pretty good result (at least visually). Credit goes to [affinelayer](https://github.com/affinelayer/pix2pix-tensorflow) for the tensorflow pix2pix package.
